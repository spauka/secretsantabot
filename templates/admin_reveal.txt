Hey {{realname}}!

You're an admin for the Secret Santa, so you can see a bit more information than everyone else.

If you ever need some extra information, give me the following commands, replacing <name> with either a persons full name or their slack handle (@ them):
*Check Allocations*
- `who has <name>`
- `who does <name> have`
- `print everyone` - list of people in the team
- `print everyone with allocations` - list of people and who they have
- `who do I have` - the usual check

There's also some functions that deal with everyone:
*Admin Functions*
- `update people list` - pull people from slack
- `reload people` - reload people list from file
- `reset seen` - reset seen indicators on everyone
- `send out allocations` - send messages to everyone with their secret santa allocations
- `post welcome message` - post the getting started message to #general
- `send admin help to <name>` - send admin help to a person
