Welcome to :christmas_tree: Secret Santa 2019: The Regiftening! :christmas_tree:

Secret santa allocations have just been sent out to everyone. You should get a message from me (<@{{ secretsantabot }}>) with the name of the person you are gifting.

A quick recap of this years rules:
 - Gifts will be exchanged on the 20th of December at the End of Year Celebration. This will give you a bit more than 2 weeks to find the right gift.
 - Change of plans regarding gift dropoffs: there will be a bucket near (the small meeting room whose name I can't remember, maybe Lagavulin) where you can leave your gifts in the morning.
 - Write the name of your special someone in big letters on the gift, but leave your own name off. Gifts should be given anonymously.
    - (Of course there are no rules against guessing who gave you what though)
 - Gift limit $20, with a bit of wiggle room :P

If you didn't get a name and you think you should have, or if you run into any problems, talk to <@{{admin}}>.

Happy Gifting!
