Hey Everyone,

Secret santa allocations have just been sent out to everyone. You should get a message from me (@secretsantabot) with the name of the person you are gifting.

First, a quick recap of the rules:
 - Gifts will be exchanged at the QNL Christmas Party, on Friday the 14th of December. That's a little under 3 weeks from today.
 - There is a $20 UPPER limit on gifts, but remember that gifts can be creative as well, they don't have to cost money at all.
 - Gifts should be given anonymously, so clearly indicate on the wrapping who it is for.

If you didn't get a name and you think you should have, or if you run into any problems, talk to @spauka.

Happy Gifting!

- Secret Santa Bot
