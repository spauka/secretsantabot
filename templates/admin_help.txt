You're an admin, you can do some extra things to administer the secret santa!

Try the following commands, replacing <name> with either a persons full name or their slack handle (@ them):
*Check Allocations*
 - `who has <name>`
 - `who does <name> have`
 - `print everyone` - list of people in the team
 - `print everyone with allocations` - list of people and who they have

*Admin Functions*
 - `update people list` - pull people from slack
 - `send out allocations` - send messages to everyone with their secret santa allocations
