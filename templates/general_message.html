<h2>Welcome to Secret Santa 2020: The Return of the Secret Santas! 🎄🎄</h2>
<p>Secret santa allocations have just been sent out to everyone. You should get a message from me (🎅 Secret Santa Bot) with the name of the person you are gifting.</p><br>
<p>Apologies for the late announcement this year 🥺someone may have underestimated how easy it would be to port this app from Slack to Teams.</p><br>
<p>A quick recap of this years rules:
<ul>
 <li>Gifts will be exchanged on the 18th of December at the 🎉 End of Year Celebration 🎉. This will give you roughly two weeks to find a gift.</li>
 <li>For Covid reasons - you will have to bring the gift with you to the Watsons Bay hotel.</li>
 <li>Write the name of your special someone in big letters on the gift, but leave your own name off. Gifts should be given anonymously.</li>
 <ul>
    <li>(Of course there are no rules against guessing who gave you what though)</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Gift limit is $20, with a bit of wiggle room 😁</li>
</ul>
</p><br>
<p>If you didn't get a name and you think you should have, or if you run into any problems, talk to Sebastian Pauka or Alexis George.</p><br>
<p>Happy Gifting 🎁!</p><br>
<p>- 🎅 Secret Santa Bot</p>
