Hey {{ realname }}!

Welcome to the Quantum Nanoscience Lab Secret Santa 2019. After taking stock of everyone in the lab and performing a quantum shuffle, I've got a name for you.

First, a quick recap of the rules:
 - Gifts will be exchanged at the QNL Christmas Party, on Friday the 14th of December. That's a little under 3 weeks from today.
 - There is a $25 UPPER limit on gifts, but remember that gifts can be creative as well, they don't have to cost money at all.
 - Gifts should be given anonymously, so clearly indicate on the wrapping who it is for.

OK, that's it for rules, once you're alone, press the button below to see who you have!

Keep it secret and good luck!
